COULD
----------
"reset stats" option for each monitor
support ping monitor type
support port monitor type
localize dates in UI
ask if they want to fix redirects when monitor is created to reduce load
Translate HTTP number codes to their descriptions in UI, also translate node request error codes
save redirects so we don't keep following them everytime a monitor is pinged?
disable web ui on remote1.ubermon.com (disable db too?)
prevent rapid bot monitor creation (same account or same ip)
put remote pinger on a different company's network than the main engines
show account monitor count usage vs account max's
validate - don't allow creation of monitors for "down" sites

delete events and pings when a monitor is deleted
show if monitor is advanced or not in monitor list
limit number of contacts per account
don't show site on remote1.ubermon.com
allow bulk monitor actions
expire accounts after 3-12 months no login activity? send email first to confirm?
don't keep showing monitor on right side if it was the last one deleted
link to github issues for issues support
highlight the selected monitor in monitor list in dashboard

WOULD
----------
find way to include google analytics in head.html
show time till next ping in UI
limit number of contacts per user to 1000
support keyword monitor type
have client refresh fast after changes but slow down later to reduce load
login with facebook and/or google
validate - don't allow domains that do not exist
clean up inline styles and br tags
allow access to dashboard before creating account?
Combine monitors from different users that use the same URL
clicking in url should put cursor at end if "http://" is in it
minify bower_componenets.js (and provide.map files)
indicate which monitor is selected on monitor list
